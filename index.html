						<p>In this books Thomas Sowell proves that it is possible to write intelligently about
							economics, without graphs, charts or calculus. Which is a point of pride for Dr Sowell: why?
							Well in his words: he wants people to read it! In Basic Economics Dr Sowell does an
							incredible job of presenting economic principles and theories in plain English and in a
							straightforward way, providing relevant examples from history as well as from present day,
							without dumbing the subject down in anyway.</p>
						<p>The overall economic viewpoint of the book could be summarized like this: “Life does not ask
							us what we want. It presents us with options.”. These options are usually limited, and we
							don’t have a full plethora of things to choose from, the book focuses on the fact that
							economics is all about allocating scarce resources with alternative uses. On a surface level
							this may seem like something negative or depressing but it isn’t: in fact, it is the exact
							opposite! By acknowledging our reality, as well as having a better understanding of the
							world around us we can go on to be more educated, make better decisions but more importantly
							live happier life because we are making educated and beneficial decisions.</p>

					<p>“Prices in a market economy are not simply numbers plucked out of the air or set arbitrarily by
						sellers. While you may put whatever price you wish on the goods or services you provide, those
						prices will become economic realities only if others are willing to pay them- and that depends
						not on whatever prices you have chosen but how much consumers want what you offer and on what
						prices other producers charge for the same goods and services.“</p>
					<p>This is illustrated beautifully by Dr Sowell in an example about ice cream. </p>
					<p>“We now need to look more closely at the process by which prices allocate scarce resources that
						have alternative uses. The situation where the consumers want product A and don’t’ want product
						B is the simplest example of how prices lead to efficiency in the use of scarce resources. But
						prices are equally important in more common and more complex situations, where consumers want
						both A and B, as well as many other things, some which require the same ingredients in their
						production. For example, consumers not only want cheese, they also want ice cream and yogurt, as
						well as other products made from milk. How do prices help the economy to determine how much milk
						should go to each of these products?"</p>
					<p>"In paying for cheese, ice cream, and yogurt, consumers are in effect also bidding indirectly on
						the milk from which these products are produced. In other words, money that comes in from the
						sales of these products is what enables the producers to again buy milk to use to continue
						making their respective products. When demand for cheese goes up, cheese-makers use their
						additional revenue to bid away some of the milk that before went into making ice cream or
						yogurt, in order to increase the output of their own product to meet the rising demand. When
						cheese-makers demand more milk, this increased demand forces up the price of milk- to everyone,
						including the producers of ice-cream and yogurt. As the producers of these other products raise
						the prices of ice cream and yogurt to cover the higher cost of the milk that goes into them,
						consumers are likely to buy les of these other dairy products at these higher prices."</p>
					<p>How will each producer know just how much milk to buy? Obviously they will buy only as much milk
						as will repay its higher costs from the higher prices of these dairy products. If consumers who
						buy ice cream are not discouraged by rising prices as consumers of yogurt are, then very little
						of the additional milk that goes into making more cheese will come from reduced production of
						ice cream and more will come from a reduced production of yogurt. What this all means as a
						general principle is that the price which one producer is willing to pay for any given
						ingredient becomes the price that other producers are forced to pay for that same ingredient.”

					<p>New York and San Francisco have very long standing and severe rent control laws, on paper this is
						to
						protect the lower-income households against greedy builders, but when taking a look at the
						cities
						with the highest rents in the United States: New York places number one and San Francisco number
						two. Is this a coincidence, if not what is going on? This isn’t an isolated instance but is
						found in
						any heavily rent controlled area all over the world.</p>
					<p>This is an importance lesson in supply and demand. Dr Sowell explains it as such: if rent control
						regulation is severe, builders either reduce the amount of housing they build, or they stop
						building
						housing all together. Which means that the political authorities in the city are confronted with
						the
						fact that there are no new houses being built and the pre-existing housing is being worn down.
						Usually faster under rent control because the landlords don’t have to keep it up as much, they
						just
						don’t get payed enough to do so. Politically you can use this to your own advantage by
						introducing a
						modification of the rent control and proclaim something along the lines of “the legislation is
						designed to protect the poor won’t, which means there is no reason to regulate the building of
						luxury housing”.</p>
					<p>The thing is that luxury housing and ordinary housing use the same labour as
						well
						as the same materials for the construction of the house in question. The materials that would
						otherwise go on into making non-luxury or middle-class priced housing is now being put towards
						building luxury housing. Which in turn means that the affordable housing is now even more
						expensive
						to build which creates even less of an incentive to build lower priced housing. Economics is
						about
						the allocation of scarce resources that have alternative uses. The result is a negative spiral
						in
						terms of building housing for the middle or lower class BUT as a politician you can reap the
						benefit
						of seemingly fighting for the poor people while shifting blame and pointing the finger at
						supposed
						greedy builders. In New York city, as of 2018, for every person experiencing homelessness there
						are
						about three vacant apartments.</p>

					<p>The world is unfair there is just no two ways about it: had you been born up in an isolated
						mountain community in the Himalayas you may or may not have gotten an education for example. The
						real problem politically, is that people act as if politics can change that unfairness. Simple
						example of this brought up by Dr Sowell, are kids who are raised by parents who are
						professionals (jobs that require higher education), hear about 2100 words per hour. Kids who are
						raised by parents who are working class people hear about 1100 words per hours. And kids who
						parents are on welfare hear around 600 words per hour. Now from an early age there is this huge
						deficit that the kid at the bottom is unlikely ever to overcome. The problem arises when people
						think that they can pinpoint where the unfairness occurred. </p>
					<p>All these kids grow up in different classes and they all go to the employer, and let’s suppose
						the employer is a fair-minded man and that he treats everybody the same, he judges everybody by
						the same performance levels. Which is reflected in his promoting and hiring practises, if you as
						a let’s say government representative doing work within discrimination at workplaces, you will
						look at these employees with no other knowledge then their job title at the company in question
						you are going to find great disparities, for example between different ethnic groups. Once
						having plucked the statistics you say: “My god too many of these people are in the top and too
						many of these people are in the bottom”. And what the fallacy there is: the assumption that the
						unfairness occurred where the statistics were collected: and there is no basis for that belief.
						In the book Dr Sowell expands further into the subject of disproportional impact to all fields
						of human endeavours, equality just doesn’t exist anywhere in proportion to percentages of the
						population. </p>
					<p>Unfortunately when people try to analyse and solve some problem in isolation, the repercussion of
						these decisions produce a result far from was anticipated. </p>

					<p>In Basic Economics Dr Sowell goes through country after country noting a lot of disparities of
						wealth; many of them are extreme. As of 2014, when the fifth edition of Basic Economics dropped,
						the GDP (gross domestic product) per capita of China was less than one fourth of that of Japan,
						and India’s GDP per capita was barely 10% of Japan. The differences between different countries
						are a lot of the time huge, and Dr Sowell offers number of comparisons of this in the book. </p>
					<p>“Many find such disparities both puzzling and troubling. But a more fundamental question
						[according to Dr Sowell] might be: was there ever any realistic chance that the nations of the
						world would have similar prospects of economic development?”. This is a good question because it
						means you don’t have to look for a bogyman to explain why everybody isn’t making the same amount
						of money or having the same amount of wealth. One simple aspect that Dr Sowell brings up when
						talking about differences in prosperity between countries is waterways, mountains and other
						geographical differences in economic development. There are for example rivers on all the
						continents, but they aren’t the same rivers. </p>
					<p>The Congo River in Central Africa is longer than the Mississippi river in the United states, but
						in a space of 150 miles there are more than 30 cataracts, and the water falls a total of almost
						1000 feet. The Mississippi river falls at a rate of 4 inches per mile. They are not the same
						river, in terms of being able to transport anything back and forth, one river opens an entire
						continent for trade while the other one, in terms of trade, does no good at all. This seemingly
						simple fact creates completely different economic landscapes.</p>

# Basic Economics #
### A Common Sense Guide to the Economy ###
My idea for my first project is to try to make a website 
around Thomas Sowell’s book “Basic Economics: A common sense guide to the economy”.
 In this book Thomas Sowell proves that it is possible to write intelligently about
  economics, without graphs, charts or calculus. In Basic Economics Dr Sowell does
   an incredible job of presenting economic principles and theories in plain English
    and in a straightforward way, providing relevant examples from history as well
     as from present day, without dumbing the subject down in anyway.

Simply put, my idea was to try adapt this book into a digital format to be able to 
keep sharing the incredible depth of knowledge that I have had the privilege to be 
able to engage in myself. 

## UX ##
Like mentioned in my introduction, my idea was just to be 
able to transfer the masterpiece that is Basic Economics 
into digital form. The two subheadings of the book is:
“A Common Sense Guide to the Economy” and ”A Citizen’s
Guide to the Economy” depending on which edition you buy. 
So it was important for me to be able to appeal to as big 
of a group of people as people as possible, to be appealing,
 read and understood by 16-90 year-olds, to further be 
 able to replicate a similar experience to the book. 
 In fact in the beginning of the book Dr. Sowell clearly 
 states that the book is for anyone looking to better 
 understand the economic reality around them, so just like 
 the book I kept my focus on the subject while trying to 
 stick to straightforward plain English. 

In the amount of time, space and skill I have my main 
goal was to give an summarized version about what the 
book is about while also trying to get people to purchase
and read the book for themselves. Economics sometimes 
get a bad reputation for being boring or complicated, 
my main goal was to help ignite peoples interest in the
subject, and therefor maximise the amount of traffic 
toward purchasing the book. Which I do by giving a 
description of the book, by lifting some parts of the 
book I find interesting and by providing several links
to purchase all throughout the page.  towards the actual
I did this by focusing on writing all content with plain 
English just like in the book. The more educated fellow 
citizens I have around me, the better.

#### User stories: ####
* As a high school student, I am writing a paper in social sciences and want to get a better understanding of some economic principles, so that I can show my teachers that I properly understand basic economic principles.
* As a high-risk group during corona crisis, I know I have a lot of free time and would like to fill it with something intellectually stimulating, I have heard of the book Basic Economics but would like some more information before I feel comfortable purchasing the book. 
* As a teenage parent, I have an obligation to teach my kids about the world, I need some basic economic examples that I can understand as well as properly explain to my kids. 

In the beginning of the project I had a clear idea of what I 
wanted to do in terms of structure of my three pages. Through
trial and error I eventually figured out that what worked on 
paper didn’t always transfer like I thought it would into digital
form. All of my initial sketches did however provide a clear direction
of where I wanted to go in terms of colour pallet and design of 
navigation bar and footer element.

## Features ##

This project has three different pages, the home page contains of
a big hero image as well as a callout section in the form of a 
jumbotron that displays the main thesis and aim of the book. 
Right underneath is the main part of the page which gives a 
overlook of the content in Basic Economics, as well as a image of
the book and a call to action button which is linked to Amazon 
where you can purchase the book. In the next section on the page
there are four different subjects discussed in the Basic Economics 
summarized by me, and these are accessible by a modal extension to 
not over crowd the page. At the very bottom there is footer that 
re-states the main thesis of the book, the same as in the callout section. 
As well as another link to where you can purchase the actual book. 

On page two, named Dr. Sowell, this page follow the same main structure
as the first page; with the same navigation bar and footer element. 
Like on the home page there is a hero image at the top of this as 
well but it doesn’t take up as much screen restate as on the home 
page. Under this there is an image as well as a description of the 
author of the book Thomas Sowell to give the visitor a bit more 
understanding of the person behind the book. In the section bellow
there some short descriptions as well as links to four more of Thomas
Sowell’s books, all within the subject of economics.    

The third page, named Newsletter, which has the same navigation 
and footer element. It contains a signup form with similar design
to the callout section on the home page, asking for: first name,
last name and email for the purpose of being able to update 
subscribers about new information about Thomas Sowell and his work.

## Features Left to Implement ##

There are a couple of things that I would like to incorporate to the page in the future:

* I personally found Thomas Sowell and Basic Economics though a 
Youtube recommendation, which literally changed my life. He brought 
a kind of clarity to the world that I had never experienced before, I would
therefor like to gives others the same opportunity to come in contact with Dr.
Sowell’s work in a long format video form through a Youtube extension. 
Some people prefer reading some prefer video, the book is designed to 
try to reach as many people as possible I would simply like to carry on 
tradition in a digital format.

* I would also like to add an extension to Amazon, or another bookselling 
website to be able to show other peoples reviews of the book, the book 
is generally well received online by many different readers. Online a main 
selling tool is to be give the potential costumer access to other peoples
experience. This allows people to have a human connection to the product
and feel more confident to click to purchase.

* Lastly, I would like to be able to actually be able to connect the 
newsletter sign up to an newsletter. As of right now I don’t have the knowledge
to do that.

## Deployment ##

I used Gitpod workspaces to be able to work on my project, 
which I accessed through GitHub follow the official instructions
from Code Institute in terms of download and launch. One of the things 
provided by the Code Institute is “gitpod-full-template” which provided
me with useful extensions, shortcuts and other useful things.

# Basic Economics #
### A Common Sense Guide to the Economy ###
My idea for my first project is to try to make a website 
around Thomas Sowell’s book “Basic Economics: A common sense guide to the economy”.
 In this book Thomas Sowell proves that it is possible to write intelligently about
  economics, without graphs, charts or calculus. In Basic Economics Dr Sowell does
   an incredible job of presenting economic principles and theories in plain English
    and in a straightforward way, providing relevant examples from history as well
     as from present day, without dumbing the subject down in anyway.

Simply put, my idea was to try adapt this book into a digital format to be able to 
keep sharing the incredible depth of knowledge that I have had the privilege to be 
able to engage in myself. 

## UX ##
Like mentioned in my introduction, my idea was just to be able to transfer the masterpiece that is Basic Economics into digital form. The two subheadings of the book is: “A Common Sense Guide to the Economy” and ”A Citizen’s Guide to the Economy” depending on which edition you buy. So it was important for me to be able to appeal to as big of a group of people as people as possible, to be appealing, read and understood by 16-90 year-olds, to further be able to replicate a similar experience to the book. In fact in the beginning of the book Dr. Sowell clearly states that the book is for anyone looking to better understand the economic reality around them, so just like the book I kept my focus on the subject while trying to stick to straightforward plain English. 

In the amount of time, space and skill I had for this project my main goal was to give a summarized version about what the book is about while also trying to get people to purchase and read the book for themselves. Economics sometimes get a bad reputation for being boring or complicated, my main goal was to help ignite people’s interest in the subject, and therefor maximise the amount of traffic toward purchasing the book. Which I do by giving a description of the book, by lifting some parts of the book I find interesting and by providing several links to purchase all throughout the page.

#### User stories: ####
* As a high school student, I am writing a paper in social sciences and want to get a better understanding of some economic principles, so that I can show my teachers that I properly understand basic economic principles.
* As a high-risk group during corona crisis, I know I have a lot of free time and would like to fill it with something intellectually stimulating, I have heard of the book Basic Economics but would like some more information before I feel comfortable purchasing the book. 
* As a teenage parent, I have an obligation to teach my kids about the world, I need some basic economic examples that I can understand as well as properly explain to my kids. 

In the beginning of the project I had a clear idea of what I 
wanted to do in terms of structure of my three pages. Through
trial and error I eventually figured out that what worked on 
paper didn’t always transfer like I thought it would into digital
form. All of my initial sketches did however provide a clear direction
of where I wanted to go in terms of colour pallet and design of 
navigation bar and footer element.

## UI ##
The color palette of my entire page is designed to replicate the colour palette on the front of the fourth edition of Basic Economics by Thomas Sowell. 


## Features ##

### Home page: ###
* Navigation bar 
     *	At the very top of the page is a navigation element that allows you to manoeuvre around the page in between the Home, Dr. Sowell and Newsletter page. In smaller screen sizes the element can be collapsed to not take up much screen real estate.
* Callout/head section
     * Under the navigation bar there is a hero image of a dollar bill with a jumbotron displaying the thesis of Basic Economics.
* General information section
     * General information section contains an overlook of the content in Basic Economics.
     * An image of the cover of the book.
     * A call to action button with the word ‘Purchase’ on it, which takes you directly to Amazon where you can buy the book. The ‘Purchase’ button has a hovering effect of changing colour when the mouse is hovering over the button to further indicate to the user that this is a call to action button. 
* Sections from the book section
     * There are four different summarized sections from Basic Economics, all identical looking. There is a header and 40 words of the main text which is followed by a ‘Read More’ button which connects to a scrollable modal element, again containing the subject headline line as well as the full text. 
* Footer
     * There are two sections: on the left the main thesis of the book is reinstated, on the right there is a section providing another link to purchase the book from Amazon, the link is accessible through clicking the book icon. The book icon has a hovering effect of changing colour to make the user more alert to the fact that the icon is a call to action. 

### Dr Sowell page ###

     * Hero image of books 
* Information about Thomas Sowell section:
     * This section has an image of Dr. Sowell, as well as information about him both as a person and as an author.

All with the title of the book as well as 40 words containing the first part in the book description as well as a ‘Learn More!’ button that takes you straight to where you can purchase that particular book on Amazon.
* Footer

* Callout/head section
     * Under the navigation bar there is a hero image of a dollar bill with a jumbotron asking if you would like to sign up for a newsletter about Dr. Sowell’s work and books. Underneath the header of the jumbotron there is a form section requesting first name, last name and email all needing to be filled in before clicking the ‘Sign Up’ button at the bottom of the form. The ‘Sign Up’ button has a hovering effect of changing colour when the mouse is hovering over the button. The sign button is of right now not connected to anything, since I don’t as of right now don’t have the knowledge to do so.
* Footer
     * There are two sections: on the left the main thesis of the book is reinstated, on the right there is a section providing another link to purchase the book from Amazon, the link is accessible through clicking the book icon.

## Features Left to Implement ##

There are a couple of things that I would like to incorporate to the page in the future:

* YouTube:
     * I personally found Thomas Sowell and Basic Economics though a Youtube recommendation, which literally changed my life. He brought a kind of clarity to the world that I had never experienced before, I would therefor like to give others the same opportunity to come in contact with Dr. Sowell’s work in a long format video form through a Youtube extension. Some people prefer reading some prefer video, the book is designed to try to reach as many people as possible I would simply like to carry on tradition in a digital format.
* Amazon reviews: 
     * I would also like to add an extension to Amazon, or another bookselling website to be able to show other people’s reviews of the book, the book is generally well received online by many different readers. Online a main selling tool is to be give the potential customer access to other people’s experience. This allows people to have a human connection to the product and feel more confident to click to purchase.
* Newsletter:
     * I would like to be able to connect the newsletter sign up to a newsletter. As of right now I don’t have the knowledge to do that.

The project is hosted on GitHub pages, published by a master branch. I used GitPod workspaces to be able to work on my project, which I accessed through GitHub, I  follow the official instructions from Code Institute in terms of download and launch. One of the things provided by the Code Institute is “gitpod-full-template” which provided me with useful extensions, shortcuts and other useful things.

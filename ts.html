						<p>Thomas Sowell has studied and taught economics and intellectual history and social
							policies at institutions that include Cornell, Brandeis, UCLA and Amherst. Now a senior
							fellow at the Hoover institution, Dr. Sowell has published over a dozen of books. Dr.
							Sowell grew up in Harlem, and dropped out of high school at 16, ended up received an
							undergraduate degree from Harvard, a master’s degree from Colombia and his doctorate
							degree from the university of Chicago. </p>
						<p>Growing up in Harlem and getting his first job delivering telegrams in Manhattan, Dr.
							Sowell really got exposed to the living conditions of the very rich and the poor. When
							going home from work he would sometimes splurge and take the Fifth Avenue bus home,
							which would drive by the very glamour’s part of the city and when he would eventually
							arrive at home he would wonder: why is this, why the huge disparity? At the time there
							was no other explanation around other than Marxism, the people who were rich had gotten
							rich by simply taking from the poor. This economic understanding was something Dr.
							Sowell carried with him into his early 20s, even when studding under what is considered
							some of the biggest defenders of free markets and founders of Chicago school of
							economics: Milton Friedman, George Stigler and Friedrich Hayek. </p>
						<p>What eventually ended up changing Dr. Sowell’s mind was not the university of Chicago. It
							was his first job working at a professional capacity for the government. As a summer
							intern at the US department of labour he began to realise that: the government is not
							simply the personification of the general will; the government institutions have their
							own institutional interests. One of these involved the minimum wage law, which he was a
							big supporter of, but he also knew that there was an argument that minimum wage law
							simply priced low wage workers out of a job. Dr. Sowell’s first assignment dealt with
							minimum wage laws within the sugar industry in Puerto Rico and as he looked at the
							numbers he would see: as the minimum wage went up the number of jobs would go down. But
							there were two explanations: number one was the one of the economists that clamed people
							were being priced out of work. The other theory was that there were hurricanes that had
							come through Puerto Rico during the sugar harvesting and it destroyed a lot of the crop,
							therefor you wouldn’t hire as many workers. </p>
						<p>In his time at the university of Chicago he had been taught that if there are two
							different theories there should be some imperial evidence in principle that could
							distinguish what would happen under one theory and what would happen under the other. He
							wrestled with that during the summer and one morning he came in and said: “I got it!
							What we need are data on the amount of sugar canes standing in the fields before the
							hurricane struck”. He waited for the applause and congratulations but instead got looks
							of chock, like: this guy has stumbled on top of something that is going to ruin us all!
						</p>
						<p>He realised that his concern was if this law was beneficial or not beneficial to low
							income people, they were concerned because this law was providing a third of the income
							of the US department of labour. And once he started to see that the government agencies
							have their own self-interest, quite aside from whatever they are theoretically supposed
							to be doing, he went on to find out how the world really works, in terms of economic
							markets. </p>
